Warning regarding cors-anywhere
Please note that cors-anywhere is used as a temporary workaround to CORS related issues which occur when developing a front-end app without a backend. In a commercial environment a project would have a backend and not need this CORS workaround.

The limitation of cors-anywhere is that access to this service is temporary. It runs out. Which stops the API from working, until access is requested manually from cors-anywhere. Access lasts maybe one or two days only.

It is fine to use as a stop-gap in development, or for people like myself who are building sample projects to develop and practice skills rather than for serious use, however is not a long term solution.
